# Statistical Analysis on Used Cars Dataset

This GitHub repository contains an R file, `main.R`, which performs a statistical analysis on a dataset used_cars.csv. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), variable selection, linear regression, and colinearity analysis. Additionally, the dataset is split into luxury, midrange, and low range car models to ensure a comprehensive analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the used_cars.csv which contains information about car types, models, car details, and selling prices. It provides a rich source of data for understanding the factors influencing car prices.

### Data Splitting

The dataset is split into luxury, midrange, and low range car models to ensure that the analysis is not biased towards any particular category. This data splitting is particularly useful in the context of analyzing car prices. Data splitting enhances the depth and granularity of the statistical analysis, ensuring a more comprehensive understanding of the used car market and the factors affecting car prices.
